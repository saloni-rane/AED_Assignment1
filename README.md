I have designed a application for people to find resources in hospital management.
This system is designed for smooth functioning of Hospitals, Doctors & Patients & System Admin 
The System Admin has access to all the records in the system and can CRUD Doctors, Patients, Hospitals & Communities.
Based on the role you can have restricted access in the view policy of the system.

The Doctors are able to log in and check and comment on the encounter record of the patient  based on the symptoms or vital signs. It can also Manages Patient Encounter information

For the Patient:
